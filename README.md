# BioThings SDK

BioThings SDK provides a Python-based toolkit to build high-performance data APIs (or web services) from a single data source or multiple data sources. It has the particular focus on building data APIs for biomedical-related entities, a.k.a “BioThings” (such as genes, genetic variants, drugs, chemicals, diseases, etc.).
